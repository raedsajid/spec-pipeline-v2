"""
Detect table ruling-line structure in a rendered drawing sheet.

Second stage of the drawing pipeline (after ``pdf_to_image``): given the
full-page sheet as PNG bytes, isolate the horizontal and vertical ruling lines
that make up equipment-schedule tables using OpenCV morphology, then union
them into a single grid mask. Downstream stages turn this grid into per-cell
regions, cluster them into table bounding boxes, and crop each table.

Ported from the ``drawing_v4`` prototype's "inverse fill" table detector, the
first step only (decode -> binarize -> per-axis line detection -> grid mask),
adapted to operate on in-memory image bytes instead of files on disk.
