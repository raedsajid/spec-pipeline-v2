"""
Detect table-cell regions from a drawing sheet's ruling-line grid.

Third stage of the drawing pipeline (after ``line_detection``). It applies the
"inverse fill" idea: instead of detecting whole tables directly, invert the
grid mask so each table *cell* interior becomes an enclosed white blob, label
those blobs with connected components, and discard the page background / noise.
The surviving cell boxes are the raw material the next stage clusters into whole
table bounding boxes.

Ported from the ``drawing_v4`` prototype's ``extract_schedule_tables.py`` (the
connected-components cell step), operating on the in-memory ``GridLines`` from
``line_detection`` instead of files on disk.
