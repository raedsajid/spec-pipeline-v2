"""
Assemble schedule-table bounding boxes from ruling-line connectivity.

Fourth stage of the drawing pipeline (after ``cell_detection``). Instead of
clustering cells by distance (which welds packed schedules into mega-tables),
run connected components on the undilated horizontal|vertical line union: each
physically connected grid of rules becomes one candidate table box. Size,
cell-density, and internal-grid filters then drop title-block / border-only
notes / stray-ink blobs.

Cells from stage 3 validate line-network candidates (minimum cell count) and
power orphan recovery for short/fragmented single-row schedules. Title rows
above the top rule are left for crop padding downstream.
